## Description ##

### Motivate.me is meant to be a simple "pick-me" up site that can help anyone who feels down or just not quite motivated.

## Structure ##

The site is structured as simple as possible with design features as minimal. 
There are 7 buttons that can be pressed that will trigger an alert which contains a positive quote and an image randomly selected.
Each button represents a day of the week.
A random number is created for the quote and the images so no two images and numbers will repeat.
FontAwesome was used to add symbols to he week days

## Errors ##

 I came across an error that took more than its share of time spent trying to find out what went wrong :
![Reccuring error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88729876/145673243-9ae8a8fe-bb07-405b-8a5c-e331ee01428b.jpg)

In the end I found the answer on a forum, it was the "." before the "/" for both the script.js file and the sweetalert function, they were missing.

## Final Result ##

A simple website that can help when feeling a bit low or not-wining as they say.
