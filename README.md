## Description ##

### Motivate.me is meant to be a simple "pick-me" up site that can help anyone who feels down or just not quite motivated.

## Structure ##

The site is structured as simple as possible with design features as minimal. 
There are 7 buttons that can be pressed that will trigger an alert which contains a positive quote and an image randomly selected.
Each button represents a day of the week.
A random number is created for the quote and the images so no two images and numbers will repeat.
